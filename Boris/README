Introduction 
-------------
Boris is a cross platform open source tetris clone, released under the permissive BSD License. This project was developed with the intention of showcasing my programming abilities in c++ and lua, which were developed while creating this project. Specific features include:

  * A resource handling system for both free files and resource files.
  * Modest graphical effects like screen fades, color overlay and zooming (Using SDL_gfx).
  * An event handling system which allows event delegation to both c++ and lua functions.
  * Simple UI controls, such as a textbox, label, and menu system.
  * Components are redrawn on a need-to refresh basis.
  * Lua bindings.
